# Fire Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project aims to detect wildfires in images and video footage using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. By leveraging the Ultralytics library and Roboflow platform, we trained and fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model on a dataset tailored for wildfire detection. The trained model can accurately identify instances of wildfires in real-world scenarios, enabling proactive fire monitoring and management.
